# coding problem

A set of Rectangular Cardboards are arranged on the X Y axis, the inputs are cardboard indices in the format (x1,x2,h), 
    
     x1 - Begin Index X Axis
     x2 - End Index X Axis
     h - Height (Y  Axis)
    
Cardboards can be  arranged in the intersecting manner, partially or fully subsumed, as a solution listing the outline listing the rise and drop. For the example given below, following is the:

Input  - [(1,5,10),(4,6,8),(10,15,10),(11,12,8)]
Output - [(1,10),(5,8),(6,0),(10,10),(15,0)]

Few more examples:


Input  - [(1,10,4),(1,8,6),(1,6,8)]
Output - [(1,8),(6,6),(8,4),(10,0)]


Input  - [(0,6,2),(5,10,8),(7,8,12)]
Output - [(0,2), (5,8),(7,12),(8,8) (10,0)]
